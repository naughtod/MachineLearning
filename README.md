## About the Project
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) implementation in C++.
Uses an object oriented approach with nodes and layers as opposed to
matrices which makes it less efficient but hopefully easy to understand.
 
All layers use sigmoid activation function, standard gradient descent 
optimisation, loss function is mean squared error, all layers except output have a bias, learning rate is 0.2,
epochs is 4000, weights are randomly initialised between 0 and 1. Note the predictions can be classified based on a decision 
boundary of 0.5 (i.e. 0.4 -> 0, 0.6 -> 1) however I haven't implemented this 
since it is more informative to know the value of the final output unit.  

The main function contains training data for learning the XOR function so it can be run straight away to see what it does.

## Libraries Used
    #include <iostream>
    #include <iomanip>
    #include <vector>
    #include <math.h>

## Getting Started
compile with `g++ -o mlp_bin_class mlp_bin_class.cpp`

run with `./mlp_bin_class`
